# pyImageTools
python scripts for image analysis

this is a worker script on my way to sort out images for a time laps video.

it opens camera images from a certain location/folder and gets out color values 
on two dedicated points in various formats (RGB, HSL, HSV).

the result of all the "measurements" are printed in a semicolon separated 
text file, for additional further analysis.
